I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for such a wonderful library.  It's really simplified and streamlined my code, not to mention allowed me to deliver sooner.  Now that I'll have an extra moment during the holidays to spend with my family, I'll raise a glass in honor of the Charts4J library and its author.

Great Library for a great service!

We use charts4j in both SWING and to send to web applications too. Even when refreshing (we graph heart rate data) every second there are no problems whatsoever.

Thanks, Brad
